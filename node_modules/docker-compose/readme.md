# Manage Docker-Compose via Node.js

`docker-compose` is a small library that allows you to run [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)(which is still required) via Node.js. This is useful to bootstrap test environments. You might also generate your `docker-compose.yml` files using [composefile](https://www.npmjs.com/package/composefile).

## Installation

```
npm install --save-dev docker-compose
```

## Usage

`docker-compose` current supports these commands:

* up - create and start containers - always uses the `-d` flag due to non interactive mode
* down - Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
* kill - Kill containers
* stop - Stop services
* rm - Remove stopped containers - always uses the `-f` flag due to non interactive mode

All commands return a Promise.

### Example

To start containers based on the `docker-compose.yml` file in your current directory, just call `compose.up` like this:

```javascript
compose.up({ cwd: path.join(__dirname), log: true })
  .then(
    () => { console.log('done')}, 
    err => { console.log('something went wrong:', err.message)}
  );
```

### Options

`docker-compose` accepts these params:

* `cwd {string}`: mandatory folder path to the `docker-compose.yml` (you don't need to specify the name of the `docker-compose.yml` - and custom file names are not supported yet ([PR ahead](https://github.com/PDMLab/docker-compose/issues/1)? ðŸ˜‰))
* `[log] {boolean}`:  optional setting to enable console logging (output of `docker-compose` `stdout`/`stderr` output)

## Running the tests

While `docker-compose` runs on Node.js 6+, running the tests requires you to use Node.js 8 as they make use of `async/await`.

```
npm test
```

## Want to help?

This project is just getting off the ground and could use some help with cleaning things up and refactoring.

If you want to contribute - we'd love it! Just open an issue to work against so you get full credit for your fork. You can open the issue first so we can discuss and you can work your fork as we go along.

If you see a bug, please be so kind as to show how it's failing, and we'll do our best to get it fixed quickly.

Before sending a PR, please [create an issue](https://github.com/PDMLab/docker-compose/issues/new) to introduce your idea and have a reference for your PR.

Also please add tests and make sure to run `npm run eslint`.
